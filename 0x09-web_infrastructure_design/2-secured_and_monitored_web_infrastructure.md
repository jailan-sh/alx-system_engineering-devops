# Secured and monitored web infrastructure
- 3 Firewalls: The first Firewall checks the rules after receiving the requests and could deny following requests. The second firewall is working in the server to prevent someone hacking depending of the requests, and the third firewall acts as a circuit-level firewalls, inspect the transaction of the information.

- 1 SSL certificate: is added to secure https protocols and encrypt communication. Then, the ‘plain text’ won’t be easy accessed or viewed by a third person.

- Firewalls is a network security device that monitors network traffic, used to allow remote access to a private network through secure authentication.

- HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure, using the secure port 443, which encrypts outgoing information.

- Monitoring is practice used for quality control, monitoring not only helps to make sure to maintain high quality levels, keeping the established standards and consistency, but also to help in the continuous improvement of the resources performance.

- IT monitoring is composed of three parts: 1) Fundation; 2) Software, and 3) Interpretation in order to function.

Foundation: Are related to the infrastructure at its lowest layer of the software stack. This includes physical and virtual devices, such as servers, CPUs and VMs.
Software: The software is the monitoring section which analyzes what is happening in the devices (physical or virtual machines) in terms of CPU usage, load, memory, and running count.
Interpretation: Here is where collected data is turned into metrics and are presented through graphs or data charts (mostly on GUI dashboard).
